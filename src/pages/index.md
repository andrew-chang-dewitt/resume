# Hi, I'm Andrew.

I'm a CS student at IIT who's commonly heard saying things like "that kicked my ass" or "that was terrible", immediately followed by "it was so much fun, let's do that again"; usually about something that happened on my bike or in an algorithms course.
When I'm not slogging my way through CLRS/RISC-V/Rust or in the middle of yet another ill-advised bike commute, I love spending time on a few [personal projects](https://github.com/andrew-chang-dewitt), cooking for my family, or going on long walks with my dog around Chicago.

If you're here, it might be because you clicked a link on my [resume](/resume/).

# Andrew Chang-DeWitt

Hi, I'm Andrew.

I'm a CS student at IIT in Chicago who's commonly heard saying things like "that was so hard and kicked my ass&mdash;it was so much fun"; usually about something that happened on my bike or in an algorithms course.
When I'm not slogging my way through CLRS or in the mimddle of yet another ill-advised bike commute I love spending time on a few [personal projects](https://github.com/andrew-chang-dewitt), cooking for my family, or going on long walks with my dog around Chicago.

If you're here, it might be because you clicked a link on my [resume](/resume/).

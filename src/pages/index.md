# Hi, I'm Andrew.

I'm a CS student at IIT in Chicago who's commonly heard saying things like "that kicked my ass" or "that was terrible" in the same breath as "that was so much fun, let's do it again"; usually about something that happened on my bike or in an algorithms course.
When I'm not slogging my way through CLRS or in the middle of yet another ill-advised bike commute, I love spending time on a few [personal projects](https://github.com/andrew-chang-dewitt), cooking for my family, or going on long walks with my dog around Chicago.

## Hire me

I'm currently looking for a summer 2025 internship as a Software Engineer.
You can find my resume [on this site](/resume/) (or [as a pdf](/resume/andrew-chang-dewitt.pdf)).
My interests are broad, but I typically get excited about a job listing when it talks about any of the following:

- mentorship & experience helping junior engineers grow
- pair programming or shadowing
- anything using Rust
- tooling (like the bike-shedding on this site that turned into [`vite-plugin-static-md`](https://github.com/andrew-chang-dewitt/vite-plugin-static-md))
- backend web work
- infrastructure

## Elsewhere

If you're here, it might be because you clicked a link on my [resume](/resume/), [github](https://github.com/andrew-chang-dewitt), or [linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/andrew-chang-dewitt).
